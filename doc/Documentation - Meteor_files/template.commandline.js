Running `meteor help` by\nitself will list the common meteor\ncommands. Running <code>meteor help <i>command</i></code> will print\ndetailed help about the command.\n\n\n<h3 id=\"meteorrun\">meteor run</h3>\n\nRun a meteor development server in the current project. Searches\nupward from the current directory for the root directory of a Meteor\nproject. Whenever you change any of the application's source files, the\nchanges are automatically detected and applied to the running\napplication.\n\nYou can use the application by pointing your web browser at\n<a href=\"http://localhost:3000\">localhost:3000</a>. No internet connection is\nrequired.\n\nThis is the default command. Simply running `meteor` is the\nsame as `meteor run`.\n\nTo pass additional options to Node.js use the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable.\nFor example: `NODE_OPTIONS='--debug'` or `NODE_OPTIONS='--debug-brk'`\n\nRun `meteor help run` to see the full list of options.\n\n\n<h3 id=\"meteorcreate\">meteor create <i>name</i></h3>\n\nCreate a new Meteor project. Makes a subdirectory named *name*\nand copies in the template app. You can pass an absolute or relative\npath.\n\n\n<h3 id=\"meteordeploy\">meteor deploy <i>site</i></h3>\n\nDeploy the project in your current directory to Meteor's servers.\n\n\nYou can deploy to any available name\nunder `meteor.com` without any additional\nconfiguration, for example, `myapp.meteor.com`.  If\nyou deploy to a custom domain, such as `myapp.mydomain.com`,\nthen you'll need to make sure the DNS for that domain is configured to\npoint at `origin.meteor.com`.\n\n\n\nYou can deploy in debug mode by passing `--debug`. This\nwill leave your source code readable by your favorite in-browser\ndebugger, just like it is in local development mode.\n\n\n\nTo delete an application you've deployed, specify\nthe `--delete` option along with the site.\n\n\n\nTo add an administrative password to your deployment, include\nthe `--password` option.  Meteor will prompt\nfor a password.  Once set, any future `meteor deploy` to\nthe same domain will require that you provide the password.  The same\npassword protects access to `meteor mongo`\nand `meteor logs`.  You can change the password by\nrunning `meteor deploy --password` again,\nwhich will first prompt for the current password, then for a new\npassword.\n\n\n",["#",[[0,"warning"]],["\nPassword protection only applies to administrative actions with the\nMeteor command.  It does not prevent access to your deployed\nwebsite.  Also, this all is a temporary hack until we have\nfull-featured Meteor accounts.\n"]],"\n\n",["#",[[0,"warning"]],["\nIf you use a domain name other than `meteor.com`\nyou must ensure that the name resolves\nto `origin.meteor.com`.  If you want a top-level\ndomain like myapp.com, you'll need a DNS A record, matching the IP\naddress of origin.meteor.com.\n"]],"\n\n\n\nYou can add information specific to a particular deployment of your application\nby using the `--settings` option.  The argument to `--settings` is a file\ncontaining any JSON string.  The object in your settings file will appear on the\nserver side of your application in [`Meteor.settings`](#meteor_settings).\n\nSettings are persistent.  When you redeploy your app, the old value will be\npreserved unless you explicitly pass new settings using the `--settings` option.\nTo unset `Meteor.settings`, pass an empty settings file.\n\n<h3 id=\"meteorlogs\">meteor logs <i>site</i></h3>\n\nRetrieves the server logs for the named Meteor application.\n\n\nMeteor redirects the output of `console.log()` in your\nserver code into a logging server.  `meteor logs`\ndisplays those logs.  In client code, the output\nof `console.log()` is available in your web browser's\ninspector, just like any other client-side JavaScript.\n\n\n<h3 id=\"meteorupdate\">meteor update</h3>\n\nSets the version of Meteor to use with the current project. If a\nrelease is specified with `--release`, set the project to use that\nversion. Otherwise download and use the latest release of Meteor.\n\nEvery project is pinned to a specific release of Meteor. You can temporarily try\nusing your package with another release by passing the `--release` option to any\ncommand; `meteor update` simply changes the pinned release.\n\n<h3 id=\"meteoradd\">meteor add <i>package</i></h3>\n\nAdd packages to your Meteor project. You can add multiple packages\nwith one command. For a list of the available packages, run `meteor\nlist`.\n\n\n<h3 id=\"meteorremove\">meteor remove <i>package</i></h3>\n\nRemoves a package previously added to your Meteor project. For a\nlist of the packages that your application is currently using, run\n`meteor list --using`.\n\n\n<h3 id=\"meteorlist\">meteor list</h3>\n\nWithout arguments, lists all available Meteor packages. To add one of\nthese packages to your project, run <code>meteor add <i>package</i></code>.\n\nWith `--using`, list the packages that you have added to your project.\n\n\n<h3 id=\"meteormongo\">meteor mongo</h3>\n\nOpen a MongoDB shell on your local development database, so that you\ncan view or manipulate it directly.\n\n",["#",[[0,"warning"]],["\nFor now, you must already have your application running locally\nwith `meteor run`. This will be easier in the future.\n"]],"\n\n\n<h3 id=\"meteorreset\">meteor reset</h3>\n\nReset the current project to a fresh state. Removes the local\nmongo database.\n\n",["#",[[0,"warning"]],["\nThis deletes your data! Make sure you do not have any information you\ncare about in your local mongo database by running `meteor\nmongo`. From the mongo shell, use `show collections`\nand <code>db.<i>collection</i>.find()</code> to inspect your data.\n"]],"\n\n",["#",[[0,"warning"]],["\nFor now, you can not run this while a development server is\nrunning. Quit all running meteor applications before running this.\n"]],"\n\n\n<h3 id=\"meteorbundle\">meteor bundle</h3>\n\nPackage the application up for deployment. The output is a tarball\nthat includes everything necessary to run the\napplication. See `README` in the tarball for details.\n\nYou can use this to host a Meteor application on your own server,\ninstead of deploying to Meteor's servers.  You will have to deal with\nlogging, monitoring, backups, load-balancing, etc, all of which we\nhandle for you if you use `meteor deploy`.\n\n"]],"\n</div>"]));
